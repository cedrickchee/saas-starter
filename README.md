# SaaS Starter

## Project Status

The project has not been updated for a _very_ long time (aside from security
fixes) for the latest in React 16+, Hooks, Apollo 3 and [Prisma
2](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/prisma/faq#since-prisma-20-is-released-will-prisma-1-still-be-maintained).

demo: _coming soon_

SaaS Starter is an open source full stack software-as-a-service online mart complete with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favourite grocery items.

This is a full stack JavaScript application built with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and friends.

## The Tech Stack

![](docs/images/tech_stack.png)

## Application Architecture

The following is the design of the frontend and backend of the application.

The application has five main models:
- Users
- Items
- Orders
- CartItems
- OrderItems

all of which are relational and utilizing the power of relational [GraphQL Queries](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/).

The app also includes many server side bits including:
- JWT authentication
- permissions
- sending email
- uploading images
- charging credit cards

## Development

Developer skills required to build an online mart with React, GraphQL and some of today's top JavaScript technology.

### React.js and Modern JavaScript

You should be already familiar with the basics of React - components, state, props, modules and event handlers.

You should be comfortable with both writing and debugging modern JavaScript including arrow functions, classes, promises, async+await and other commonly used parts of [ES6](http://exploringjs.com/es6/).

The backend of the app is written in Node.js. Prior Node.js knowledge is nice, but not required.

The app requires knowledge of GraphQL, [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/client/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), databases, or [testing React components](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/guides/jest.html).

### What is GraphQL?

Just as React has transformed the way we build web applications, GraphQL is changing how we build APIs to query and mutate data.

<img src="docs/images/graphql_code_example.png" width="300" />

GraphQL is a type-safe query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

What?! It's a replacement for (_or addition to_) your REST API and Ajax Calls.

GraphQL requires buy-in from both your client and your server â€” it then puts the power of requesting **only what you want** into the client and the business logic of finding and filtering that data into **backend resolvers**.

It enables libraries that make caching, loading, error handling and pagination a breeze.

Complex Relational Data queries and server-side mutations like signing up or checking-out are a snap with GraphQL.

GraphQL is just a standard and can be implemented in any language or framework.
